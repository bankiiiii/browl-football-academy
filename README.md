My first paid project using react to its full extent. Think of any additional library... oh yea I used it.
you guessed right, instead of vanilla CSS i opted for the ever sexy Tailwind CSS.
its almost ready to use just a few things i need to fix and trust me its awesome. As soon as its done you would get a demo on my website https://adebankoleolowojoba.netlify.app/



I PROMISE YOU BE THE FIRST TO SEE WHEN ITS READY!!!
